pypolymake
==========

What is it?
-----------

The Python module pypolymake provides wrappers for `polymake
<https://polymake.org/doku.php>`_.

The language has been kept as close as possible as the original. The
following polymake construction::

    polytope> $c = cube(5);
    polytope> print $c->F_VECTOR;
    32 80 80 40 10
    polytope> $g = $c->GRAPH;
    polytope> print $g->DIAMETER;
    5

is translated in Python as::

    >>> from polymake import *
    >>> c = cube(5)
    >>> print(c.F_VECTOR)
    (32, 80, 80, 40, 10)
    >>> g = c.GRAPH
    >>> print(g.DIAMETER)
    5

The library is currently under development and is compatible with Python2 and
Python3. As it is under development, many things are not working and are likely
to break.

Installation and source code
----------------------------

In principle, pypolymake could be used with Python2, Python3 and within Sage.

### Installation of against current stable version of polymake inside Sage

If you are using `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org>`_ then just run the following
two commands

    $ sage -i polymake
    $ sage -pip install git+https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake [--user] [--upgrade]

Note that this uses the stable version of polymake and is not further developed.

### Installation against the beta version of polymake inside Sage

1. Clone the branch `u/vdelecroix/lrslib+polymakebeta` from the trac Sage server

2. Install the beta version of polymake inside Sage

    $ sage -f lrslib
    $ sage -f polymake

(several perl libraries are required for the compilation of polymake)

3. Install pypolymake beta

    $ sage -pip install git+https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake@beta [--user] [--upgrade]


### Installation against the beta version of polymake in Python2 or Python3

1. Clone, compile and install the last beta of polymake from https://github.com/polymake/polymake

2. Install pypolymake

    $ pip install  git+https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake@beta [--user] [--upgrade]


### Extra notes

If polymake headers or libraries are installed in a non standard location you
may need to set the environment variables CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS. For example,
on OS X, you need to update LDFLAGS as::

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/ $LDFLAGS"
    $ python setup.py install --user

You might also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting Python if the shared
library of polymake (libpolymake.so) is not in a standard directory. For example

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/path/to/lib/ ipython
